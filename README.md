# Overview
TL;DR: This app's first goal is to accept surrender form info and spit out populated intake information, skipping the paper transcription step between the surrender and intake forms.

# Goals
The goal of this application is to automate and streamline the paperwork, and digital work processes for cats cared for by Felines and Friends NM (F&FNM).

Felines and Friends NM relies heavily on volunteers for its second chance guaranteed placement mission.  Some of the processes are hands-on with cat care. Some are paper and digital work.  This app will reduce errors and delays while freeing volunteers for the rest of the operations, allowing F&FNM to reach more cats and save more lives.

## The manual process

A cat comes to F&F via surrender or transfer with an appropriate surrender form.  These forms include owner surrender, stray surrender, pregnant/nursing cat surrender, and rescue surrender. 

A team member transcribes the surrender form into an intake form, standardizing the fields among all types of surrender.
Most crucially, a unique RESCUE ID is assigned to the cat.

Note: pregnant cats and young kittens are sometimes handled in groups.


## Automation
The app takes the surrender information and converts it into the intake form.
### Flexibility
Any and all information can be missing or wrong. This is why it is so essential to get a Rescue ID assigned to each cat. Information is updated for the cat based on its Rescue ID.
### Environment
This app should be usable on iPhones, iPads and Android devices on and off the Internet.
### Ease of use
 For ease of use, the app reproduces the surrender forms.
 
TBD how Rescue ID is generated.
