# F&F Update 20230301

## New Issues

DOB needs to be on _all_ forms.

Stray Tame/Feral should be a choice, not text. (friendly, semi-feral, feral, unknown) and on every form.
(Currently appears after breed / color / markings, on Stray form.)

Spay / neutered should be on every form.

Female / Male / Unknown should be on every form. Same place: after cat name, etc.

Personality and Intake notes should be on every form?

Lump "Special needs/habits/personality" together on all forms.
This should appear just after Current diet/medications.

"Download Forms" button needs to show feedback right away - because it takes time to generate forms.
Also show timeout error (async rqst timeout).

Lisa will send an update on single-row CSV column order. For now, append a column for friendly/feral.

Consider changing file names to `(cat-name)_(intake|surrender|rescue|etc)_(rescue id).(extension)`

If no cat name is provided, use "Unknown".

### Future Work

Be able to upload bonus files. All uploads should be attached to the surrender email.
For first draft, rename based on file purpose, following Lisa's template.

## Questions

Q: Would iPad be used for taking cat photos?
A: It's most likely that photos will be taken on a phone. So it would be better to choose a file and upload.
