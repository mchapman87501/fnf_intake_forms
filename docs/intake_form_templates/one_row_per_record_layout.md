# Overview

The F&F intake workflow involves a Google Sheet document that contains one intake record per row. Thanks to Lisa Phifer, here are the columns used by that document:

- Location
- Adult cat/mama cat name
- KITTEN NAME
- INTAKE DATE
- SOURCE/intake info
- RESCUE ID
- GENDER
- BREED/COLOR
- DOB
- Weight/date
- CHIP#
- FVRCP#1 date (due at >=2lbs)
- FVRCP#2 (due 3--4 weeks after #1)
- FVCRP#3
- DEWORMED date
- RABIES vax date
- TESTED date (neg unless stated)
- S/N date
- Check this box when added to Portal
- Check this box when added to Pawlytics
- Notes

## Additional Notes

(These are also from Lisa.)

We can somewhat revise column headings to better align with the standard intake form.

We can add columns to the right to capture additional info we want to retain from the surrender form.

"Location" currently is a mix of location and foster contact info. It _should_ contain text that gives either a known hosting location for a given cat &mdash; SFC, Petco, Teca Tu, etc. &mdash; or the name of a cat foster/adopter who has possession of the cat.
